# Two-phase-IFISS

A modification of the open-source software package IFISS (version 3.3), see http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~djs/ifiss/ for details, to incorporate two-phase flow into the driven cavity problem. The edits made are not intended to be general purpose and may break other test problems and functionality.
